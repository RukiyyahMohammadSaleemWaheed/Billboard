                <p>I was a liar</p>
<p>I gave in to the fire</p>
<p>I know I should've fought it</p>
<p>At least I'm being honest</p>
<p>Feel like a failure</p>
<p>'Cause I know that I failed you</p>
<p>I should've done you better</p>
<p>'Cause you don't want a liar</p>

<p>And I know, and I know, and I know</p>
<p>She gives you everything,</p>
<p>But, boy, I couldn't give it to you</p>
<p>And I know, and I know, and I know</p>
<p>That you got everything,</p>
<p>But I got nothing here without you</p>

<p>So one last time</p>
<p>I need to be the one who takes you home</p>
<p>One more time</p>
<p>I promise, after that, I'll let you go</p>
<p>Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart</p>
<p>All I really care is you wake up in my arms</p>
<p>One last time</p>
<p>I need to be the one who takes you home</p>

<p>I don't deserve it</p>
<p>I know I don't deserve it,</p>
<p>But stay with me a minute</p>
<p>I swear I'll make it worth it</p>
<p>Can't you forgive me?</p>
<p>At least just temporarily</p>
<p>I know that this is my fault</p>
<p>I should've been more careful</p>

<p>And I know, and I know, and I know</p>
<p>She gives you everything,</p>
<p>But, boy, I couldn't give it to you</p>
<p>And I know, and I know, and I know</p>
<p>That you got everything,</p>
<p>But I got nothing here without you, baby</p>

<p>So one last time</p>
<p>I need to be the one who takes you home</p>
<p>One more time</p>
<p>I promise, after that I'll let you go</p>
<p>Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart</p>
<p>All I really care is you wake up in my arms</p>
<p>One last time</p>
<p>I need to be the one who takes you home (la li he)</p>

<p>I know I should've fought it</p>
<p>At least I'm being honest (yeah)</p>
<p>But stay with me a minute</p>
<p>I swear I'll make it worth it, babe</p>
<p>'Cause I don't wanna be without you</p>

<p>(Oh)</p>
